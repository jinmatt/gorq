// The extensions package contains some common extensions to the SQL
// standard.  We intend to maintain extensions mostly for postgresql,
// but extensions for other SQLs are most certainly welcome.  I do
// intend to include functionality for MySQL and SQLite equivalent to
// postgresql's extensions when possible.  The extensions tend to have
// very different syntax, though, so language-specific type assertions
// or function calls will be necessary.
